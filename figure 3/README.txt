Folder “figure 3” contains the codes, the results, and the parameters used for the simulations shown in Figure 3. 

Please run the codes in the following order:
1. “figure3ab_Simulation_noDelay.py” runs the simulation and produces the parameters in “figure3ab_rec_latin_hypercube_samples.csv” and the results in folder “figure3ab_mcmc_res”. 
2. “plotSimulation” summarizes the results in “figure3ab_rec_summary” and plots Figure 3A and Figure 3B. The same codes can be used to plot the results of Figure 3C-H simulations.  

Figure 3C-H can be plotted similarly using their corresponding codes in step 1 and “plotSimulation” in step 2 after changing the corresponding input data.
