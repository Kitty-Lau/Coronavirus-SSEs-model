Folder “figure 5” contains the codes, the results, and the parameters used to retrospectively estimate the epidemic size of the Tao Heung Cluster and the Fulum Cluster in Figure 5. 

Please run the codes in the following order:
1. “TaoHeung_COVID-19.py” runs the estimation using the data in “data_COVID_TaoHeung.csv” and produces results in folder “mcmc_result_TaoHeung”. 
2. “plot_TaoHeung.py” plots Figure 5A-C.

Figure 5D-F can be plotted similarly using the codes in step 1 and step 2 after changing the corresponding input data and parameters.
